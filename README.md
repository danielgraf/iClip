# iClip
DukeScript client app for coupons

This app runs on web, iOS or Android and connects to our iClip back end service which is integrated with Mondo bank.

Our back end service gives you a selection of coupons which you can 'clip' into your wallet

When you make a payment with your Mondo card, if the coupon is valid it will be automatically redeemed for you and 
added to your Mondo transaction feed.
